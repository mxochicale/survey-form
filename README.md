# Survey Form

A Survey Form That I Made To Learn Css Concepts

## Setup
1. clone repo https://github.com/lazy-geek/survey-form
2. Commit any changes
3. go to [settings/pages](https://github.com/mxochicale/survey-form/settings/pages) and select branch main `/(root)`. 

## What I Learned

1. How To Make Custom CheckBox.
2. About Css Positioning.
3. How To Bind Checked Event To `Label` (give `checkbox` an `id` and in `Label` set `for` attribute to that `id` , now we can check the checkbox by clicking anything that is inside the `Label`).
